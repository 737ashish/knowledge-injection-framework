Lahontan cutthroat trout live in small , isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams , many of them in the Trout Creek Mountains . These populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation . For most of the 20th century , the trout 's numbers declined considerably . It was listed under federal law as an endangered species in 1970 and was reclassified as threatened in 1975 . Reasons for the fish 's decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , overfishing , competition with other fish , and hybridization with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased the number of genetically pure Lahontan cutthroat trout . However , reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zones since the 1980s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover .", "The entire mountain range is very remote ; as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness @-@ like experience .

In fact , with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook , the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring , neither one knowing that the others have done likewise . The humor in this piece centers around this pie . What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination . Imagine eight people , not to speak of the cat , getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie ! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week . Licensed as well as Independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters . The mince pie episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone . \" Walton of The Moving Picture News was not amused by the plot and stated , \" To me the last scene had no humor . It was only the necessary ending to the beginning . True humor does not emanate from cognac . \" The New York Dramatic Mirror stated , \" This is the old story of too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way .
